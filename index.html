<section id="about">

<h2>Who We Are</h2>

<p><strong>Institutional Compliance and Governance Infrastructure.</strong></p>

<p>GAIATECH is not a software company. We operate as an institutional ecosystem designed to organize information, validate processes and connect governments, organizations and initiatives under clear governance and international standards.</p>

<p>Our work focuses on building environments of trust, regulatory alignment and strategic articulation — especially in areas such as diplomatic cooperation, ESG frameworks, public innovation and global institutional integration.</p>

<p>Technology is only a means, never the end. What defines GAIATECH is the creation of structured models that transform complex ideas into viable, credible and internationally aligned initiatives.</p>

<p>By acting as an intelligent compliance infrastructure, GAIATECH helps institutions navigate regulatory challenges, strengthen governance practices and establish bridges between Brazil and the global ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Institutional Leadership</h2>

<p>GAIATECH was founded by Reinaldo Adeodato, an institutional strategist focused on governance design, international articulation and the development of structured initiatives capable of connecting innovation, public systems and global cooperation.</p>
